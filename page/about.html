<b>Guido Fu&agrave;</b>, <b>Eikona studio</b>’s founder and director, is a photographer member of the Italian Press since 1991, holds an MA in <b>visual anthropology</b>
at the University of Rome (La Sapienza) and speaks two languages (<b>English</b> and <b>Spanish</b>). His career as a professional photographer has spanned 
over the last twenty-five years. Blending the curious eye of a photojournalist with brainstorming innovative photographic techniques, Guido Fu&agrave; 
has led through the years an intense portraits activity, photographing many familiar names of show-biz, culture, finance, as well as common 
people from every cultural and ethnic context.</p>

<p>His deep antropological interest for various and foreign cultures has led him to travel around <b>Africa</b>, <b>South America</b>, the <b>Caribbean</b>, <b>Asia</b>, <b>the U.S.</b>, 
    <b>Europe</b> and <b>Italy</b>. Switching from aesthetical and technical issues to the search of human nature, as a reporter he has been covering a variety of 
    social subjects, such as ethnic realties in their domestic environment as well as in their immigration contexts; nightlife, music and teenage 
    trends; community projects and humanitarian subjects.</p>

After a series of short <b>seminars</b>, Guido’s teaching career has taken off  in 2004 as a <b>teacher</b> in Editorial Portrait along four years 
at <a href= "http://www.scuolaromanadifotografia.it" target="_blank"><b>The Roman School of Photography</b></a>.
Actually he teaches the Advanced Course of Studio Photographic Lighting Techniques 
at <a href="http://www.officinefotografiche.org" target="_blank"><b>Officine Fotografiche</b></a> in Rome.
Recently Guido has been running a basic photography workshop for the faculty of Communication students at <b>Makeni University</b> in Sierra Leone.
The ground of his teaching attitude can be explained with his own words:
“in our rather snobbish circles of photography, It is often said that only failed photographers teach… what a load of arrogant nonsense.  
Teaching is not only about a job or a  ‘giving back knowledge’.  It is an amazing way to understand your own skills and better yourself 
as a photographer on both a professional and a very personal level. Teaching what I myself love so much and sharing the same passion with others, 
It is a way to become a better, more passionate and honest person.”</p>
